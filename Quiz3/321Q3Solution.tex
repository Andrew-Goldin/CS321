Quiz 3
Consider the following recurrence

T(N) = T(N/2) + 2T(N/4) + N
T(1) = 2

  1. Draw the top three levels for this recurrence.
  
                        N
     [N/2]             [N/4]             [N/4]
[N/4][N/8][N/8]   [N/8][N/16][N/16]   [N/8][N/16][N/16]

  2. What is the total amount of work done at the second level(at depth 1) of the tree? Your answer must be fully simplified.
    
    N
    
  3. What is the total amount of work done at the third level(at depth 2) of the tree?
  
    N
  
  4. What is the depth of the deepest leaf in the complete tree?
  
    log_2(N)
  
  5. What is the depth of the shallowest leaf in the complete tree?
  
    log_4(N)
