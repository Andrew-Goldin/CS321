Give the full definition of the recurrence of T(N) that represents the EXACT number of comparisons that are ACTUALLY performed in the worst cae by each one of the algorithms below.

Part 1: T(0) = 1
        T(N) = T(N/3) + (N^3) + 1
        
Part 2: T(0) = 1
        T(1) = 1
        T(N) = N * T(N-1) + 2
