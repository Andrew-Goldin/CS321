1. (2 points) Intuitively explain why search always returns the correct value.

  The search continues at changing indicies. After each iteration the search becomes more and more thorough until finally iterating over each element in the array. 
    
2. How many times is the line "if (a[i] == x) return i;" executed during the first iteration of the outer loop, i.e., when h is a.length = 2^k?

  Answer: 1

3. How many times is the line "if (a[i] == x) return i;" executed during the second iteration of the outer loop, i.e., when h is a.length/2 = 2^(k-1)?

  Answer: 2

4. How many times is the line "if (a[i] == x) return i;" executed during the third iteration of the outer loop, i.e., when h is a.length/4 = 2^(k-2)?

  Answer: 4

5. How many times is the line "if (a[i] == x) return i;" executed during the last iteration of the outer loop, i.e., when h = 1?

  Answer: a.length times

6. Write a summation expression for the total number of times the line "if (a[i] == x) return i;" is executed over ALL of the iterations of the outer loop, by filling in the mission parts of the following summation. 
                    
  S = sum(i=0)^(k) 2^i
  
7. Evaluate S from Q6, i.e., give a FULLY SIMPLIFIED, closed-form formula for it. 
  S = 2^(k+1) - 1
